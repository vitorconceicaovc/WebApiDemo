<p>
    A general description of my API:
</p>

```bash 
http://testarwebapivc.somee.com/Help
```
    
# Technologies
- C#
- SQL

# Requirements
- Recommended software for testing the API is Postman.
    - Postman is API testing software that allows you to send HTTP requests to an API and view the responses.
    - Using Postman is recommended due to the advanced features it offers for testing different types of requests such as POST and PUT requests, as well as the easy-to-use interface for viewing API responses.
- For better performance the minimum requirements for programming include: 
    - Intel Core i5 or i7 processor. 
    - Full HD resolution, ideally 1920Ã—1080. 
    - 8GB of RAM.
